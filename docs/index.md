# Rafael’s Cheat Sheets

A growing collection of deeply structured, idiomatic programming cheat sheets.
This is not meant as a public standard but just for my personal use

## Cheat Sheets

- [C++](./cheat-sheets/cpp.md) — Hardcore, explicit, bare-metal
- [Java](./cheat-sheets/java.md) — OOP warhorse, enterprise-core, still evolving
- [JavaScript](./cheat-sheets/javascript.md) — Dynamic, weird, but still everywhere
- [Kotlin](./cheat-sheets/kotlin.md) — Succinct, expressive, JVM-chic
- [Scala](./cheat-sheets/scala.md) — Functional, expressive, opinionated
- [TypeScript](./cheat-sheets/typescript.md) — JavaScript but with a damn safety net
